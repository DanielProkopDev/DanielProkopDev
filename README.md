## ⭐ Featured Projects

👾 Pacman Game with A* Pathfinding

A university project implementing a Pacman-style game with A* used for ghost pathfinding.
The system was built as a multithreaded application with synchronized execution, in line with project requirements.

My primary focus was ensuring that ghosts remain a consistent challenge for the player.
Thanks to the A* algorithm, ghosts can efficiently navigate the map and reliably locate the player, creating unpredictable and engaging gameplay.
Additionally, the map is randomly generated at each run, making it difficult for the player to memorize layouts or predict ghost routes.
Map shapes had to follow Pac-Man’s visual conventions, that's why certain layouts may recur depending on the selected size(small<repeats<big).

The game also includes player-activated skills that can be collected during gameplay and used strategically.
The project took approximately 14 days to complete. While it could be further expanded(ghost spreading while off the chase still needs some tweaks, removing some blocks of code which ultimately never been in use), I decided to move on after achieving a functional and enjoyable version.

📚 BooksLib

A simple library-management application designed to streamline the process of registering users, renting books for a fee, and handling different access roles.
The system includes separate permissions for administrators, registered users, and guests, allowing each group to interact with the library according to its privileges.

The project was built using the Spring framework, with Hibernate for ORM and an in-memory H2 database for data storage.
Its primary goal was to provide a clear and functional structure for managing book rentals while keeping the overall architecture lightweight and easy to extend.
